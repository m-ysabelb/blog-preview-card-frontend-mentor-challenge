# blog-preview-card-frontend-mentor-challenge
My most recent attempt at working on an HTML and CSS challenge was in January 2024, where I implemented the provided design of the Frontend Mentor Challenge.

I began this challenge on January 17, 2024, and am now announcing its completion on March 11. Even though I wasn't entirely satisfied with the result, I made the decision to call it finished and focus on accepting and honing my coding skills for the next few more challenges.

In essence, I can still say that the final result looks nearly similar to the given example.
