# blog-preview-card-frontend-mentor-challenge
Currently a WIP project, imitating the given design through the implemention HTML and CSS.

I started this challenge last Jan 17 and I will upload my current progress (95% as I declare) this Jan 19 for documentation purposes.

I am still unsatisfied of the "95%" so I will update this till I made the final output, which will be soon. Hopefully.
